# Personal-Projectts
A repository with some of my personal projects developed during University and high-school.
Here you will find:

### Azure Buckets Management (Spring Boot & React Typescript)
A web application that communicates with an Azure database. Developed during my full-stack internship 
at FME Cluj-Napoca. The application allows users to retrieve the buckets from the database and select a 
bucket to view files from it and perform various operations on them.
Technologies used for backend:
- Java/Spring Boot
- JUnit 5 for testing
- PostgreSQL for database
- Azure Blobs for communicating with the Azure database
Technologies used for frontend:
- React/Typescript
- Tailwind for styling

### Finance Tracker Mobile Application (Kotlin, Spring Boot)
- Faculty project developed for the Mobile Applications course

- Java Spring Boot for the server part
- Also uses a local database for when the application is not connected to the server

### Connect-4 (Python)
- It is a version of the connect-4 game
- Helped get a better understanding of programming paradigms, unit testing and layered architecture
- GUI version implemented with pygame
- The computer player uses a version of the MinMax algorithm
- It contains a "settings.txt" file where you can set how you wish to play the game:
  - If GUI is off you play it in the console
  - If AI is off you can play it player vs. player


### Hangman Game (Python)

  swap <word> <letter> - <word> <letter>
  undo

### Pet Shelter Management Application (C++, Qt)

OOP and I worked for the first time with a graphical interface framework.
- It uses multiple types of repositories such as: Memory Repository, File Repository, HTML Repository, CSV Repository
- I also worked with the STL library, templates etc.

### Toy Language Interpreter (Java, Javafx)
- Developed during second year of faculty for the Advanced Programming Methods course.
- A system that allows step-by-step execution of the main instructions.

    - declaration statement
