# Personal-Projectts
A repository with some of my personal projects developed during University and high-school.
Here you will find:
### Connect-4
- It is a version of the connect-4 game
- Helped get a better understanding of programming paradigms, unit testing and layered architecture

### Hangman Game
- The game use a File Repository. The computer will select a random sentence from the file and the user will have to guess it.
- Each time the user guesses a letter, the computer will fill it in the correct position
- In case that the letter si not correct, the computer will add a new letter to the word "hangman"
- The game ends when the sentence is guessed (user wins) or when the computer fills the word "hangman" (user loses),

### Scranble Game
- The object of the game is to order the scrambled letters into the correct order, by switching one pair at a time
- The first and last letters will always be correct.
- It is a command based game, the commands are:
  swap <word> <letter> - <word> <letter>
  undo

### Pet Shelter Management Application
- Faculty project developed for the OOP course. Through this I went deeper in the main principles of 
OOP and I worked for the first time with a graphical interface framework.
- It uses multiple types of repositories such as: Memory Repository, File Repository, HTML Repository, CSV Repository
- I also worked with the STL library, templates etc.
